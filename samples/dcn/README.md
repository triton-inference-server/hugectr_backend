# DCN SAMPLE 
A sample of deploying Deep & Cross Network with HugeCTR Backend [(link)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05123.pdf).

## Dataset and preprocess 
The data is provided by CriteoLabs (http://azuremlsampleexperiments.blob.core.windows.net/criteo/day_1.gz).
Each example contains a label (1 if the ad was clicked, otherwise 0) and 39 features (13 integer features and 26 categorical features).
The dataset also has the significant amounts of missing values across the feature columns, which should be preprocessed accordingly.
The original test set doesn't contain labels, so it's not used.


### Requirements
* Python >= 3.6.9
* Pandas 1.0.1
* Sklearn 0.22.1
* CPU MEMORY >= 10GB 

### 1. Download the dataset and preprocess 

Go to [(link)](http://azuremlsampleexperiments.blob.core.windows.net/criteo/day_1.gz)
and download the kaggle-display dataset into the folder "${project_home}/tools/".


####  Download the Kaggle Criteo dataset using the following command: 
```shell.
$ wget http://azuremlsampleexperiments.blob.core.windows.net/criteo/day_1.gz
```

#### Extract the dataset using the following command:
```shell.
$ gzip -d day_1.gz
```

#### Preprocess the data using the following commands:
The script `preprocess.py` fills the missing values by mapping them to the unused unique integer or category.
It also replaces unique values which appear less than six times across the entire dataset with the unique value for missing values.
Its purpose is to reduce the vocabulary size of each column while not losing too much information.
In addition, it normalizes the integer feature values to the range [0, 1],
but it doesn't create any feature crosses. Please go to the folder "${project_home}/tools/" for data preprocessing.
```shell.
$ mkdir dcn_data
$ tail -n 10000 day_1 > train.txt
$ python3 ./preprocess.py --src_csv_path=train.txt --dst_csv_path=dcn_data/test.txt --normalize_dense=1 --feature_cross=0
```

#### Convert the criteo data to inference format
The HugeCTR inference requires dense features, embedding columns and row pointers of slots as the input and gives the prediction result as the output. We need to convert the criteo data to inference format (csr) first.
```shell.
$ python3 ./criteo2predict.py --src_csv_path=dcn_data/test.txt --src_config=../samples/dcn/dcn_data.json --dst_path=./dcn_csr.txt --segmentation ',' --batch_size=1
```
As result, CSR format input will be generated into dcn_csr.txt and the content as below:
```shell.
Label:0
DES: 0.0388349514563106,0.1674641148325358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.0268456375838926,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CATCOLUMN: 45,112,529,782,836,926,988,1344,1476,1546,1685,1934,1996,2060,2258,2292,2309,2344,2365,2402,2511,2623,2727,3138,3175,3203
ROWINDEX: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26
```

## 2. Get DCN trained model files
Go to [(DCN training sample))](https://github.com/NVIDIA/HugeCTR/tree/master/samples/dcn#training-with-hugectr) in HugeCTR and make sure to store the trained dense model and embedding table files into the folder "${project_home}/samples/dcn/1/". In order to ensure that the training and inference configuration are consistent, please use the dcn_train.json file in the directory "${project_home}/samples/dcn". Please keep the "source" and "eval_source" data directories consistent if you change the default storage directory for preprocessed data.  

## 3. Create inference configuration files
### DCN model network configuration 
Check the stored model files that will be used in the inference, and create the JSON file for inference. We should remove the solver and optimizer clauses. The paths of the stored dense model and sparse model(s) should be specified at "dense_model_file" and "sparse_model_file" within the inference clause. We need to make some modifications to "data" in the layers clause. Besides, we need to change the last layer from BinaryCrossEntropyLoss to Sigmoid. The rest of "layers" should be exactly the same as that in the training JSON file. You may go to "${project_home}/samples/dcn/1/dcn.json" for reference. All inference-related network configurations will be automatically generated after training.

### HugeCTR Backend configuration 
Please refer to  [(Triton model configuration))](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md) first and  clarify the required configuration of the model in the specific inference scenario.
In order to deploy the HugeCTR model, some customized configuration items need to be added as follows：
```json.
 parameters [
  {
  key: "config"
  value: { string_value: "/model/dcn/1/dcn.json" }
  },
  {
  key: "hit_rate_threshold"
  value: { string_value: "0.8" }
  },
  {
  key: "gpucache"
  value: { string_value: "true" }
  },
  {
  key: "gpucacheper"
  value: { string_value: "0.5" }
  },
  {
  key: "label_dim"
  value: { string_value: "1" }
  },
  {
  key: "slots"
  value: { string_value: "26" }
  },
  {
  key: "cat_feature_num"
  value: { string_value: "26" }
  },
  {
  key: "des_feature_num"
  value: { string_value: "13" }
  },
  {
  key: "max_nnz"
  value: { string_value: "2" }
  },
  {
  key: "embedding_vector_size"
  value: { string_value: "32" }
  },
  {
  key: "embeddingkey_long_type"
  value: { string_value: "false" }
  }
]
```  
The configuration items described above have been added to the sample "${project_home}/samples/dcn/config.pbtxt".  

The model files (the path of the embedded table file) needs to be configured in a separate "${project_home}/samples/ps.json", because the localized parameter server will pre-load the embedding tables independently.

```json.
{
    "supportlonglong":false,
    "models":[
        {
            "model":"dcn",
            "sparse_files":["/model/dcn/1/0_sparse_file.model"],
            "dense_file":"/model/dcn/1/_dense_file.model",
            "network_file":"/model/dcn/1/dcn.json"
        }
    ]  
}

]
``` 

If you use Parquet format data as input to train the model in [**2. Get DCN trained model files**](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/dl/hugectr/hugectr_inference_backend/-/blob/main/samples/dcn/README.md#2-get-dcn-trained-model-files), it means that the key type of the embedding table is I64 (the default is I32), so the configuration file needs to be modified as follows:  
```json.
 parameters [
...
  {
  key: "embeddingkey_long_type"
  value: { string_value: "true" }
  }
... 
]
```  

Add the **supportlonglong** to "${project_home}/samples/ps.json" as follows:
```json.
 {
    "supportlonglong":true,
    ...
    models":[
    ...
    ]
  }
```  

## 4. Launch Triton server 
Before you can use the HugeCTR Docker image you must install Docker. If you plan on using a GPU for inference you must also install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. DGX users should follow Preparing to use NVIDIA Containers. 

Pull the image using the following command.
```shell.
$ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/merlin/merlin-inference:0.5.2
```
Use the following command to run Triton with the dcn sample model repository. If the deepfm model files are not trained and exported before, please remove the "${project_home}/samples/deepfm". The NVIDIA Container Toolkit must be installed for Docker to recognize the GPU(s). The --gpus=1 flag indicates that 1 system GPU should be made available to Triton for inferencing.   

- If building HugeCTR Backend from Scratch, please specify "--backend-directory" argument value as the absolute path that installs the HugeCTR backend.  
- If the key value type of the embedding table is I64, please add "--backend-config=hugectr,supportlonglong=true".    

You can pull the `Merlin-Inference` container by running the following command:  

```shell.
docker run --gpus=1 --rm  -p 8005:8000 -p 8004:8001 -p 8003:8002 \    
-v /hugectr_backend/samples/:/model  nvcr.io/nvidia/merlin/merlin-inference:0.5.2 /bin/bash
```

Launch the Triton server to load the DCN model by running the following command:  
```shell.
root@2efa5b50b909: tritonserver --model-repository=/model/ --load-model=dcn --model-control-mode=explicit \   
 --backend-directory=/usr/local/hugectr/backends/ \  
 --backend-config=hugectr,ps=/model/ps.json 
```
All the models should show "READY" status to indicate that they loaded correctly. If a model fails to load the status will report the failure and a reason for the failure. If your model is not displayed in the table check the path to the model repository and your CUDA drivers.
```shell.

Use Triton’s ready endpoint to verify that the server and the models are ready for inference. From the host system use curl to access the HTTP endpoint that indicates server status.
```shell.
$ curl -v localhost:8005/v2/health/ready
...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK

< Content-Type: text/plain
```
## 4. Run DCN client 
The Client libraries image are available in the NVIDIA container repository at the following location: https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tritonserver.    

The client tags are <xx.yy>-py3-clientsdk, Where <xx.yy> is the version that you want to pull.For stability considerations, we recommend using 20.10. HugeCTR Backend provided a client example for your reference, The input data is generated in `1.Download the dataset and preprocess` part.  

If the key value type of the embedding table is I64, please change the **dtype** of "CATCOLUMN" input data from "**uint32**" to "**int64**" in dcn_client.py. 

```shell.
$ docker run --rm --net=host -v /hugectr_backend/samples/dcn:/dcn nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:20.10-py3-clientsdk python3 /dcn/dcn_client.py
```
To send a request for the dcn model. In this case we ask for the 10 samples for prediction.
```shell.
{'id': '1', 'model_name': 'dcn', 'model_version': '1', 'parameters': {'NumSample': 1, 'DeviceID': 0}, 'outputs': [{'name': 'OUTPUT0', 'datatype': 'FP32', 'shape': [1], 'parameters': {'binary_data_size': 3328}}]}
