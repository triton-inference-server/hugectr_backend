# DeepFM SAMPLE 
A sample of deploying DeepFM Network with Hugectr backend [(link)](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2017/0239.pdf).

## Dataset and preprocess 
The data is provided by CriteoLabs (http://azuremlsampleexperiments.blob.core.windows.net/criteo/day_1.gz).
Each example contains a label (1 if the ad was clicked, otherwise 0) and 39 features (13 integer features and 26 categorical features).
The dataset also has the significant amounts of missing values across the feature columns, which should be preprocessed accordingly.
The original test set doesn't contain labels, so it's not used.


### Requirements
* Python >= 3.6.9
* Pandas 1.0.1
* Sklearn 0.22.1
* CPU MEMORY >= 10GB

### 1. Download the dataset and preprocess 

Go to [(link)](http://azuremlsampleexperiments.blob.core.windows.net/criteo/day_1.gz)
and download the kaggle-display dataset into the folder "${project_home}/tools/".


####  Download the Kaggle Criteo dataset using the following command: 
```shell.
$ wget  http://azuremlsampleexperiments.blob.core.windows.net/criteo/day_1.gz
```

#### Extract the dataset using the following command:
```shell.
$ gzip -d day_1.gz
```

#### preprocess the data using the following commands:
The script `preprocess.py` fills the missing values by mapping them to the unused unique integer or category.
It also replaces unique values which appear less than six times across the entire dataset with the unique value for missing values.
Its purpose is to reduce the vocabulary size of each column while not losing too much information.
In addition, it normalizes the integer feature values to the range [0, 1],
but it doesn't create any feature crosses. Please go to the folder "${project_home}/tools/" for data preprocessing.
```shell.
$ mkdir deepfm_data
$ tail -n 10000 day_1 > train.txt
$ python3 ./preprocess.py --src_csv_path=train.txt --dst_csv_path=deepfm_data/test.txt --normalize_dense=1 --feature_cross=0
```

#### Convert the criteo data to inference format
The HugeCTR inference requires dense features, embedding columns and row pointers of slots as the input and gives the prediction result as the output. We need to convert the criteo data to inference format (csr) first.
```shell.
$ python3 ./criteo2predict.py --src_csv_path=deepfm_data/test.txt --src_config=../samples/deepfm/deepfm_data.json --dst_path=./deepfm_csr.txt --segmentation ',' --batch_size=1
```
As result, CSR format input will be generated into deepfm_csr.txt and the content as below:
```shell.
Label:0
DES: 0.0388349514563106,0.1674641148325358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.0268456375838926,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CATCOLUMN: 45,112,529,782,836,926,988,1344,1476,1546,1685,1934,1996,2060,2258,2292,2309,2344,2365,2402,2511,2623,2727,3138,3175,3203
ROWINDEX: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26
```


## 2. Get Deepfm trained model files
Go to [(deepfm training sample))](https://github.com/NVIDIA/HugeCTR/tree/master/samples/deepfm#training-with-hugectr) in HugeCTR and make sure store the trained dense model and embedding table files into the folder "${project_home}/samples/deepfm/1/". In order to ensure that the training and inference configuration are consistent, please use the deepfm_train.json file in the directory "${project_home}/samples/deepfm". Please keep the "source" and "eval_source" data directories consistent if you change the default storage directory for preprocessed data.  

## 3. Create inference configuration files
### Deepfm model network configuration 
Check the stored model files that will be used in the inference, and create the JSON file for inference. We should remove the solver and optimizer clauses and add the inference clause in the JSON file. The paths of the stored dense model and sparse model(s) should be specified at "dense_model_file" and "sparse_model_file" within the inference clause. We need to make some modifications to "data" in the layers clause. Besides, we need to change the last layer from BinaryCrossEntropyLoss to Sigmoid. The rest of "layers" should be exactly the same as that in the training JSON file. You may go to "${project_home}/samples/deepfm/1/deepfm.json" for reference.

### Hugectr backend configuration 
Please refer to  [(Triton model configuration))](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md) first and o clarify the required configuration of the model in the specific inference scenario.
For deploy the Hugectr model, Some customized configuration items need to be added as follows：
```json.
 parameters [
  {
  key: "config"
  value: { string_value: "/model/deepfm/1/deepfm.json" }
  },
   {
  key: "gpucache"
  value: { string_value: "true" }
  },
  {
  key: "gpucacheper"
  value: { string_value: "0.5" }
  },
  {
  key: "label_dim"
  value: { string_value: "1" }
  },
  {
  key: "slots"
  value: { string_value: "26" }
  },
  {
  key: "cat_feature_num"
  value: { string_value: "26" }
  },
  {
  key: "des_feature_num"
  value: { string_value: "13" }
  },
  {
  key: "max_nnz"
  value: { string_value: "2" }
  },
  {
  key: "embedding_vector_size"
  value: { string_value: "32" }
  },
  {
  key: "embeddingkey_long_type"
  value: { string_value: "false" }
  }
]
```  
The configuration items described above have been added to the sample "${project_home}/samples/deepfm/config.pbtxt". 

## 4. Launch Triton Server to load DCN and Deepfm 
Before you can use the Hugectr Docker image you must install Docker. If you plan on using a GPU for inference you must also install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. DGX users should follow Preparing to use NVIDIA Containers. 

Pull the image using the following command.
```shell.
$ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/hugectr_backend:v3.0-inference
```
In this sample, the DCN model and Deepfm model can be deployed simultaneously with multiple model instances in the same GPU. Please ensure that you can successfully deploy the dcn model according to the instructions in the "${project_home}/samples/dcn".  
Use the following command to run Triton with the deepfm and dcn sample model repository. The NVIDIA Container Toolkit must be installed for Docker to recognize the GPU(s). The --gpus=1 flag indicates that 1 system GPU should be made available to Triton for inferencing.  If building HugeCTR Backend from Scratch, please specify "--backend-directory" argument value as the absolute path that installs the HugeCTR backend.
```shell.
 docker run --gpus=1 --rm  -p 8005:8000 -p 8004:8001 -p 8003:8002  -v /hugectr_backend/samples/:/model  nvcr.io/nvidia/hugectr_backend:v3.0-inference  tritonserver --model-repository=/model/ --backend-directory=/usr/local/hugectr/backends/ \
--backend-config=hugectr,dcn=/model/dcn/1/dcn.json --backend-config=hugectr,deepfm=/model/deepfm/1/deepfm.json  \
```
All the models should show "READY" status to indicate that they loaded correctly. If a model fails to load the status will report the failure and a reason for the failure. If your model is not displayed in the table check the path to the model repository and your CUDA drivers.
```shell.

Use Triton’s ready endpoint to verify that the server and the models are ready for inference. From the host system use curl to access the HTTP endpoint that indicates server status.
```shell.
$ curl -v localhost:8005/v2/health/ready
...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0

```
## 4. Run Deepfm Client 
The Client libraries and examples image are available in the NVIDIA container repository at the following location: https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tritonserver.  

The Clinet tags are <xx.yy>-py3-clientsdk, Where <xx.yy> is the version that you want to pull.For stability considerations, we recommend using 20.10. Hugectr backend provided a client example for your reference, The input data is generated in `1.Download the dataset and preprocess` part
```shell.
$ docker run --rm --net=host -v /hugectr_backend/samples/deepfm:/deepfm nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:20.10-py3-clientsdk python3 /deepfm/deepfm_client.py
```
To send a request for the deepfm model. In this case we ask for the 10 samples for prediction.
```shell.
{'id': '1', 'model_name': 'deepfm', 'model_version': '1', 'parameters': {'NumSample': 1, 'DeviceID': 0}, 'outputs': [{'name': 'OUTPUT0', 'datatype': 'FP32', 'shape': [1], 'parameters': {'binary_data_size': 3328}}]}
[0.30833802]
```
